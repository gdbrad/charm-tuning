# charm quark mass tuning for $N_f = 2+1$ flavors 

six iterations of stout link smearing 

Our ensemble was generated with fixed light and strange quark masses and dynamical charm, thus we must ``tune" $m_c$. This entails finding the value of $am_c$ where the linear fit to measured values of the charmonium splitting ration crosses the physical PDG value. 

We choose a set of four bare charm quark masses, $am_c$ to be 0.15,0.25,0.3,0.35, all in fm. 

We compute the $D_s$ spectrum, which has flavor content $c\bar{s}$ using both point and smeared sink operators.
